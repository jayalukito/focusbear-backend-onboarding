# Git Understanding: Staging vs. Committing
**Role:** Developer Intern

## 1. What is the difference between staging and committing?
*   **Staging (`git add`):** Prepares selected changes in a temporary preview area (the index). It acts as a draft or preparation area where you select exactly which files or line changes you want to include in your next snapshot.
*   **Committing (`git commit`):** Takes a permanent snapshot of everything in the staging area and records it into the repository's history with a unique commit hash, author details, and commit message.

## 2. Why does Git separate these two steps?
*   Git separates staging and committing to give developers fine-grained control over version control history. It allows you to create **atomic commits**—small, focused snapshots that address a single logical change or bug fix—even if you edited multiple unrelated files during a coding session.

## 3. When would you want to stage changes without committing?
*   **Partial Commits:** When you have edited several files (e.g., refactored a database module and updated a UI component), but want to split them into separate, distinct commits for better clarity during code reviews.
*   **Incremental Reviewing:** When you want to stage verified, working code file-by-file while continuing to test or tweak other parts of the codebase.
*   **Organizing Work:** When preparing a clean, structured set of changes right before crafting a detailed commit message.
